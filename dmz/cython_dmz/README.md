This `cython_dmz` directory is a replica of the one we use to build and run
model-training scripts for character recognition, using [Cython](http://cython.org).

In our case, this directory lives within the same directory that contains our
various Python scripts. As you can see, a clone of the `card.io-dmz` repository
is expected to exist here *within* this `cython_stuff` directory.

Also included here is a copy of the OpenCV library, along with notes on how we
most recently built OpenCV for use in this context (on laptop, in this case,
rather than on phones).
